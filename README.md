# ISS Dashboard
We track ISS telemetry data and display it in a fancy way. [Visit the site](https://iss-dashboard.github.io). You can check out the 3D position of the station in real time, see it's altitude evolve and monitor crucial system data.  

A lot of credit is owed to the ISS Mimic project. They were the main inspiration for this endeavor, and here and there I got to reuse some of their code. You can find their public Github repo [here](https://github.com/ISS-Mimic/Mimic) and their telemetry tracking site [here](https://iss-mimic.github.io/Mimic/).
